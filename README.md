## Check your understanding q's (FILL OUT)
1. In your own words: Where would you fit your automated tests in your Bujo project development pipeline? 1

2. No, as this messaging feature would most likely require reliance on and interaction with other components, which is not something that unit tests are suited for.

3. Yes, max message length is fairly separate from other components, and so will not be affected by other changes to the application.

4. What do you expect to happen if we run our puppeteer tests with the field “headless” set to true?

5. What would your beforeAll callback look like if you wanted to start from the settings page before every test case?
